Submission Manifest

Include the following files and folders in the final zip/tar submission:

1) Configuration
- configs/train.yaml
- environment.yml
- requirements.txt

2) Source code (minimal needed for training + inference + app)
- src/ (entire folder, excluding `__pycache__/`)

3) Weights
- weights/best.pt (best model)
- weights/last_epochXXX.pt (optionally include last checkpoint)

4) Documentation (now centralized under docs/)
- README.md (root quickstart)
- docs/REPORT.md
- docs/REPORT_ASCII.txt
- docs/updated_tools.txt
- docs/README_submission.md
- submission/submission_manifest.txt (this file)

5) Data (datasets + processed)
- data/ (root folder containing datasets and processed data)
- If size is large, you may include only a text pointer: data/README.txt with dataset source or generation instructions.

6) API Keys (handle with care)
- secrets/gemini_api_key.txt (copied from env/gemini_keys.txt if you explicitly agree)

7) Root entrypoints
- app.py (Streamlit app wrapper)
- cli.py (CLI inference entrypoint)

Exclusions (to keep package light and focused)
- runs/ (training debug artifacts)
- yolov8n.pt and other detection weights
- YOLO-specific datasets (e.g., datasets/fruit_det/) and labels
- YOLO-related source files (e.g., src/detect.py, src/eval_yolo.py, src/audit_yolo_dataset.py)
- fastapi-related code (not present after pruning)

Notes
- The minimal runtime dependencies are in requirements.txt (pruned).
- For exact best validation accuracy, extract from weights/best.pt.
